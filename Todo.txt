- Implement cd with ../../../ / and - 
- Finish ls implementation with -a and -l options
- make a theme
- make another application 
- probably publish first draft 
- set pwd in terminal needs to actually look at the dirs available
- Implement cat to cat out multiple files
- Implement structure for commands
- Add a way to add commands to classes ( maybe mixin )
    - commands should have man pages and help pages 

- Implement more tests
- Implement up go through all history

Notes:
- It's been nice having a project to dump ideas into

- Apparently to use require with an export default you need a babel.config.json
Tests are good

- Testing is very satisfying sense of relief having a verifiable way to test my code

- Testing forces code abstraction making code more separated which is a very nice side effect testable code is reusable code
